# Mousetracking of categorization-processes

This experiment tries to replicate the first mousetracking-experiment of the paper "Graded Motor Responses in the time course of categorizing atypical exemplars" by Rick Dale and colleagues (2007). This replication is the final project of the course "Experimental Psychology Lab" by Prof. Michael Franke. 
Authors of this code are Lars Weidtmann, Christina Popic, Julia Voss and Lukas Sch√ºler.  

## Experiment

In this experiment participants are confronted with a stimulus which they need to assign into one of two categories by clicking the respective button. We analyzed the data of the mouse-cursors trajectory for each trial, to see whether there was a difference in the decision between typical and atypical stimuli for a category.
