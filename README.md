# Replicating a Mouse-tracking Experiment 

Our experiment tries to replicate the first mousetracking-experiment of the paper "Graded Motor Responses in the time course of categorizing atypical exemplars" by Rick Dale and colleagues (2007). This replication is the final project of the course "Experimental Psychology Lab" by Prof. Michael Franke (Summer term 2020). 
Authors of this code are Lars Weidtmann, Christina Popic, Julia Voss and Lukas Sch√ºler (Group10). The **Design Plan** and our experiment can be found in the **experiments** folder, the **Preregistration**  in the **first submission** folder and the final **term paper** can be found in the folder **writing**.

## Experiment

In this experiment participants are confronted with a stimulus which they need to assign to of to one of two categories by clicking the respective button. We analyzed the data of mouse-cursor trajectories for each trial, to see whether there was a difference between trials with typical and atypical stimuli of a category.
