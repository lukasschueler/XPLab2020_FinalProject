# First submission

This folder contains the following:

1. Experimental Design Document

2. Preregistration Report

3. Pilot Study Folder 

The Pilot Study Folder contains two separate subdirectories one for the main replication part of our project and another for the additional part we created.
Each subdirectory contains:

- A folder for the analysis: Here you will find .Rmd and .html files of the visualisation and analysis.

- A folder for the data processing: Here you will find raw and final data, as well as the preprocessing script as .Rmd and .html.
