            This experiment is divided in two parts. In the first one you will be shown the name of an animal and afterwards you need to choose the category that suits this animal best <b>as fast as possible</b>.
            In the second part you do the same , but with city-names.
            <br />
            <br />
            Don't worry, this experiment is really simple and to get you started, we will properly instruct you and then start with a little practice session.`,

  <br />
  <br />
  The experiments set-up is quite simple:
  <br />

  Before the beginning of each trial you press the little red button at the bottom of your screen. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Afterwards the button will disappear and just above your cursor the word in question will appear. Immediately after that, two catgeories in the upper left and right corner respectively will be visible. 
  <br />
  <br />

  You simply need to pick the correct category <b>as fast as you can</b>. 
  <br />
  That's already it! Let's begin with a short practice.

            But don't worry, this part is way shorter than the first one. In part two you simply need to categorize city-names into capital and non-capital cities.
